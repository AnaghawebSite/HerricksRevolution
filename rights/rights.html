            <h2>Protesting Rights</h2>
            <p>One of the rights that you have are your PROTESTING RIGHTS. You have the right to protest against the British. 
              The British have put many taxes against you, inlcuding the Sugar Act of 1764, the Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend
              Acts of 1767, and many more. However, don't protest unless it's absolutely necessary. You don't want to bring up 
              unnecessary conflicts with Britain!</p>

            <h2>Government Rights</h2>
            <p>Another right that you have is to SELF GOVERN yourselves. Even though Britain is your mother country,  
              you do not need to ask permission from Britain every time you create a law between yourselves. You can  
              create your own laws and govern yourselves, independent of British control. You may also conduct meetings 
              within yourselves, to talk about any issues within the colonies.</p>

            <p>Additionally, you have the right to own your property without interferance. For instance, you can 
              carry weapons to defend yourself against sudden threats or dangers. You may also possess any other
              types of property, provided they don't pose as a threat to other nations.</p>
